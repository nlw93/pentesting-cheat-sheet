Attempt 1 of the OSCP didn't go so well. This project should help with Attempt 2


# Steps of penetration test/Components of cheetsheet
1. Initial Foothold
	- List of ports	numerically ordered - for each port have the following sections:
		- [ ] Easy wins
		- [ ] Further enumeration
		- [ ] Common Errors/Fixes
		- [ ] For each NODE above, have a counter - this could help to be more effecient in the future.
1. Privilege Escalation
	- List of vectors, ordered by used count. Include the following for each vector:
		- [ ] Windows/Linux/Both?
		- [ ] Detection method; what command/script can detect this?
		- [ ] Exploitation method; command or binary used to exploit this vector
		- [ ] Counter; how many times was this exploit used?

1. Auxiliary Commands/Methods:
	- This is for things that may be used at any stage. Exfiltration, listeners, etc.
		- [ ] Windows/Linux/Both?
		- [ ] Counter

### Questions to answer
- [ ] Does AD need it's own section?
